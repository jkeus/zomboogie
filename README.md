# Maps and Menu

The menu is very basic right now, if this were to expand,
I would have a system to sort, select, and input

The best two maps in my opinion are beatmap and beatmap0

beatmap has no shurikens while 0 has the shurikens, both have the same spawn

## Making your own maps

I made some python scripts that help make beat maps,

to use, first chose the song in the AudioManagerm

then record yourself "clicking" where you want and finish the song

take the logs and put them into the raw_click_input file for in the BeatHelp directory

do the same but for shurikens you want to drop

with basic python knowledge you shoudl be able to run and handle it

you can also use parts of existing beat maps to create new ones

# Apologize and Moving Forward

There are some unused assets and scripts that are kinda empty, I had plans but they are still in development

I tried to keep it to a mininum, regardless I apologize

Thank you for reading this far if you have!
